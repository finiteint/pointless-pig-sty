A Totally Bad Pig Server
------------------------

A _totally_ pointless server that stores pigs for no good reason.

Usage
-----

The following runs the server at http://localhost:7781/pig/

```
./server.sh 
```

To use a different port or host, use `--port` and `--host` options:

e.g. to run on port 8888:

```
./server.sh --port 8888
```


For additional options, run:
```
./server.sh --help
```
